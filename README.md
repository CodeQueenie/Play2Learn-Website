# Welcome to the Play2Learn Website - Dive Into the Math Facts Practice Game!

## Hello There!
This is my very first creation from my journey as a Full Stack Developer student. I put together a math game on an educational website all built from scratch. This Math Facts Practice game is just the beginning.

## How to Get Started
Whether you're all about clicking through a graphical interface or you're a keyboard warrior who loves the command line, starting this game is a breeze. Here's how:

### If You're Using a Web Browser:
1. **Finding the Game**: First things first, locate `index.html` in your project folder.
2. **Opening the Game**: Next, give that `index.html` file a good right-click and choose “Open with” followed by whichever web browser you love the most (like Chrome or Firefox).

### If Command Lines Are Your Jam:
1. **Opening Command Line**:
   - **Windows Crew**: Click the `Start` button, start typing `cmd`, and hit `Enter`.
   - **Mac/Linux Folks**: Go find `Terminal` hanging out in your Applications folder under `Utilities`.
2. **Getting to Your Game Folder**:
   - **On Windows**: Punch in `cd \Users\YourUsername\Documents\YourProjectFolder`.
   - **Using macOS/Linux?**: Type `cd /Users/YourUsername/Documents/YourProjectFolder`.
   - Don’t forget to swap out `YourUsername` and `YourProjectFolder` with your actual info.
3. **Launching the Game**:
   - If you're on Windows, type `start index.html`, macOS users go with `open index.html`, and on Linux, it's `xdg-open index.html`.

## Wrapping Up
So, no matter if you're team mouse-click or team command-line, these steps will get you into the game in no time. Pick what feels right, dive in, and here's hoping you have a blast learning and playing. Happy mathing, and happy coding!
